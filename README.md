# Software-trials_task_1

This repo is for task 1 of software trials for team Deimos.

Summary of what we do in this repo :
1. We launch a custom gazebo world with a turtlebot.
2. We create a map of that gazebo world by teleoperating turtlebot3_burger in that world and save it using map_server node.
3. We do autonomous navigation of turtlebot3_burger on that map using DWA planner in ROS and visualize LIDAR sensor data.

Resources used : ROS Noetic, turtlebot3 robot(burger) , ROS navigation stack, Gazebo, Rviz.

Here are the step to follow to achieve the goal :
